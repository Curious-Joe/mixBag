\usage{
barPlot(
  dataset,
  classVar,
  order = NULL,
  colors = NULL,
  barType = "dodge",
  loc = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Name of the data frame object}

\item{classVar}{Name of the target feature}

\item{order}{A vector listing the target feature labels in the desired order. To use default order leave this parameter. Default value NULL.}

\item{colors}{A vector listing which color to use to represent which target feature label. To have the function pick color leave this parameter. Default value NULL.}

\item{loc}{A string with the directory where you want to save the plots. If no location is provided the plots will be created and displayed but not stored as image files.}

\item If loc has location provided, creates and saves the plots. Doesn't display in RStudio.
}
}
\description{
Creates (or saves as png if asked) bar plots for all density features. Organize the bar plots based on target feature categories and desired barplot types of: dodge, stack, fill.
